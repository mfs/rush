## Description

I'm completing the chapter 7 (Project: Cracking Shells) exercises from Practical
Unix Programming by Robbins and Robbins in Rust.

This is a learning experience and the shell is fairly useless for now. It also
probably has some security issues as there is no real sanity checking performed
on the user input.

## Progress

- [x] Program 7.1 This is just a header file I'm not using.
- [x] Program 7.2 Version 1 - A simple shell.
- [x] Program 7.3 Version 2 - More error checking.
- [x] Program 7.4 Redirection - The next three programs implement redirection.
- [x] Program 7.5 Redirection.
- [x] Program 7.6 Redirection.
- [ ] Program 7.7 Pipelines.
- [ ] Program 7.8 Pipelines.
- [ ] Program 7.9 Version 3 - Ignore SIGINT and SIGQUIT.
- [ ] Program 7.10 Handle Ctrl-C.
- [ ] Program 7.11 Background processes.
- [ ] Program 7.12 Handle zombies.
- [ ] Program 7.13 Handle zombies using `waitpid`.
